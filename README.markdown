# Name to Advisor #

This is a very simple python tool that reads a name or list of names, looks
this name up on Math Genealogy, and then returns the advisors for that name.

- If the given name doesn't give any matches, it raises an error.
- If more than one match is returned, it raises an error and spits out a URL
  for the page containing the matches.


## Be kind to Math Genealogy ##

MathGenealogy is a wonderful, kind resource. They have the database out there
for the public to explore. **Don't abuse their openness.**

This tool is not a good tool to try to scrape MathGenealogy. *Please don't use
this to try to scrape MathGenealogy.*
